The day that I dont know anything about programming and my friend start talking about it, and I don't know what he was saying that time but I was curious and I want to know more about it. Then, I search for the basic and watch some brief videos in youtube on where should I start first , what language should I choose first ,I even watch some basic of IT's. In this topic I will answer all of these questions to guide you.

## How I start in coding ?

- First, I watch some videos in youtube to motivate myself
- Then, I learn **html** and **CSS** , I spend almost 2 weeks to master this two
- After that I learn the basics of Javascript , this is where the programming begins
  but that's only in the beginning, just like in mathematics there are **operators**, **statements**,**problem solvings**

## So, Where Should I start first ? ðŸ¤”

- I highly recommended to learn **html** first either you want to be a backend developer or front-end
- After you learn html go with **CSS** to style you webpage
- Then, learn **Javascript** for interactivity

Spend **2-3** months and **3-5** hours per day and eventually you will master it in no time

> While learning you should also be aware what technologies are quite popular this day
