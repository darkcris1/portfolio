# Best Mobile Code Editor ?

## 1. [Acode - powerful code editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acodefree)

Acode is light weight yet powerful code editor and web IDE for android. You can use this editor for editing HTML, JavaScript, text. You can create website, run the website in browser and see error or logs in the console.
Also edit any kind of source file like, python, CSS, html, java, JavaScript, Dart etc.

This is my favorite code editor especially if you are focusing on web development but you can also run other language
as stated on the description.

so you can use VSCode in your android. This is best if you have external keyboard and mouse, but if you haven't it's a waste
of time to download it.
