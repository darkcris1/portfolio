**MongoDB** (from humongous) is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas.

As a web developer and my laptop is not always on my side and I came up in an idea what if I will try to code
using my phone. And Yes, I found a great way to run mongodb in android alongside with [Acode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acodefree&hl=en&gl=us), acode is the best choice for code editting it has all the features you need with excellent workspace.

## How to run MongoDB in android ?

Try to connect the database in mongo client I personally use **[Mongo Lime](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mongolime.app)** because it has everything I need even though it was a paid app. Fortunately, there was a modified version of this app and you can download it for free.
