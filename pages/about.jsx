          <h1>Hi! I am Cris Fandi√±o Jr.</h1>
          <p>
            I am 18 years old from the Philippines a self taught web developer
            with 1 year of experience. I build websites according to web
            standards guidelines. I have experience few of the languages and
            frameworks such as HTML, CSS ,Javascript, Nodejs, Bootstrap, Sass
            React/Next.js and Svelte.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first I intended to be a web designer but my pulse was truly more
            on programming. I tried back-end development since it was more on
            programming and building API from sratch using nodejs and mongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            When building websites, I usually use Next.js as a default default
            framework for faster development. I built some my own libraries in
            npm packages as you can see on my
            <a href="https://github.com/darkcris1">Github</a> Page
